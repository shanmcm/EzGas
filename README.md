# EZGas

SE 2020 project @PoliTO under supervision of Prof. Maurizio Morision and Luca Ardito

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC)

Developed together with Loredana Finocchiaro (@s269731) and Matteo Marino (@marinomatteo95).
