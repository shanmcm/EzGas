Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
- Good group dynamics
- Working in a stimulating environment
- Gained knowledge of Spring Framework


# Worst things
- Time consuming (3 people worked in our team, not 4)
- Last minute changes extended the deadline, that overlapped with exam session
- Limited availability in the assistance for students


# Suggestions 
The idea for the project was interesting and exciting, but we feel that the course was not as well organised as it should have been (also due to Covid). For the future, our suggestion is to maintain the idea of the web application, but with more support from the professors (e.g. introduction to Spring Framework).
